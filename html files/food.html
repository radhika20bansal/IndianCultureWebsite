        Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. 
        Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially
        and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.
        The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs are examples.
        <br><br>
        Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country.
        The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. 
        A number of these such as the potato, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and Guava have become staples in many regions of India.
        Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.
        Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.

    <h2>Etiquettes</h2>
    <p>
        Traditionally, meals in India were eaten while seated either on the floor or on very low stools or mattress.
         Food is most often eaten with the hands rather than cutlery. Often roti is used to scoop curry without allowing it to touch
        the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of roti is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the roti down with the index finger.
        A somewhat different method is used in the south for the dosai, the adai, and the uththappam, where the middle finger is pressed down to hold the crepe down and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. 
        Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India.
