        Clothing in India is dependent upon the different ethnicity, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. 
        Historically, male and female clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, dhoti, lungi, sari, gamcha, and
        loincloths to cover the body into elaborate costumes not only used in daily wear, but also on festive occasions, as well as rituals and dance performances. 
        In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn by people of all social levels. India also has a great diversity in terms of weaves, fibers, colours, 
        and material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. 
        The clothing in India also encompasses the wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishment, styles of wearing clothes.
        A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.
