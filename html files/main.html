        The culture of India refers collectively to the thousands of distinct and unique cultures of all religions
         and communities present in India. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from 
         place to place within the country. Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced 
         by a history that is several millennia old. Many elements of India's diverse cultures, such as Indian religions, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies
          have a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India and the world.

        India's diversity has inspired many writers to pen their perceptions of the country's culture.
         These writings paint a complex and often conflicting picture of the culture of India.
          India is one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse countries in the world. 
          The concept of "Indian culture" is a very complex and complicated matter. 
          Indian citizens are divided into various ethnic, religious, caste, linguistic and regional groups, making the realities of "Indianness" extremely complicated. 
          This is why the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions 
          about what concisely the expression "Indian" means. However, despite this vast and heterogeneous composition, the creation of some sort of typical or shared Indian culture results from some inherent internal forces (such as a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, flexible federal structure, secular educational policy, etc.) and from certain historical events (such as Indian Independence Movement, Partition, wars against Pakistan, etc.)

    <h2><i>Greetings</i></h2>

    <p>
        The Namaste is one of the most popular Indian customs and isn't just restricted to the Indian territory anymore.
         You have Barack Obama, who has been seen doing it on various occasions, or you had Ban Ki-mooning, the UN Secretary-General, greeting everyone with a namaste at the Times Square 
         in New York on the first International Yoga Day. But, what's the significance? The Namaste, or namaskar, or 'namaskar' is one of the five forms of traditional greetings
          mentioned in the ancient Hindu scriptures, the Vedas. It translates to 'I bow to you', and greeting one another with it is a way of saying 'May our minds meet', indicated by the folded palms placed before the chest. 
          The word Namaha can also be translated as 'na ma' (not mine), to signify the reductions of one's ego in the presence of the other.

        <b> "Atithi Devo Bhava"</b>
        <br>
         In India, the saying 'Atithi Devo Bhavah' is also integral. It means 'the guest is equivalent to god'. 
         It is a Sanskrit verse taken from the Hindu scriptures, which later became a part of the 'Code of conduct for Hindu society
         since the guest has always been of supreme importance in the Culture of India.
        Hospitality means relationship between a host and guest , where the host always receives the guest with full honor.
        Our heritage is famous for its hospitality . 
        we treat our guest as God enters our home we give full respect to them and offer best services in terms of food and lodging.
        Our old saying is very famous in this context "Atithi Devo Bhava"

    <h2><i>Music</i></h2>
    <p>
        Music is an integral part of India's culture. Natyasastra, a 2000-year-old Sanskrit text, describes five systems of taxonomy to classify musical instruments.
         One of these ancient Indian systems classifies musical instruments into four groups according to four primary sources of vibration: strings, membranes, cymbals, and air. According to Reis Flora, this is similar to the Western theory of organology. 
         Archeologists have also reported the discovery of a 3000-year-old, 20-key, carefully shaped polished basalt lithophone in the highlands of Odisha.
        <br>
        Prominent contemporary Indian musical forms included filmi and Indipop. Filmi refers to the wide range of music written and performed for mainstream Indian cinema, primarily Bollywood, and accounts for more than 70 percent of all music sales in the country.
         Indipop is one of the most popular contemporary styles of Indian music which is either a fusion of Indian folk, classical or Sufi music with Western musical traditions.
