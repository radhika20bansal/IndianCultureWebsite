        India is a land of festivals and fairs. Virtually celebrating each day of the year, there are more festivals celebrated in India than anywhere else in
        the world. Each festival pertains to different occasions, some welcome the seasons of the year, the harvest, the rains, or the full moon.
        Others celebrate religious occasions, the birthdays of divine beings and saints, or the advent of the New Year. A number of these festivals are common to most parts of India. 
        However, they may be called by different names in various parts of the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion.
        Some of the festivals celebrated all over India are mentioned below. However, this section is still under enhancement.

        As Siddharth Katragadda, a famous writer of the Indian origin puts it “The Greatness of a Culture can be found in its Festivals”,
        so, the greatness of a country like India can be examined by sparing a glance at the vivid and vivacious list of festivals in India. Such diverse cultures,
        culminating such varied festivals and that too under the name of a single country; such is the greatness of Indian culture. The wide spectrum of religions, occupations,
        and faiths in the country being the prime cause of such diversification, these festivals are celebrated with sheer enthusiasm and devotion.
