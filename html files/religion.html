    <h1><i>Indian Religions</i></h1>
    <img src="images/religion/main.jpg" alt="photo">
    <p>
        Religion in India is characterised by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. The preamble of Indian constitution states that India is a secular state. 
        There is separation of the state and religion, such as religious instructions cannot be imparted at public schools and political parties cannot ask for votes during elections in the name of religion.
        The Indian subcontinent is the birthplace of four of the world's major religions; namely Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. According to the 2011 census, 
        79.8% of the population of India practices Hinduism, 14.2% adheres to Islam, 2.3% adheres to Christianity, 1.7% adheres to Sikhism, 0.7% adheres to Buddhism and 0.4% adheres to Jainism.
        Zoroastrianism, Sanamahism and Judaism also have an ancient history in India, and each has several thousands of Indian adherents. India has the largest population of people adhering to Zoroastrianism (i.e. Parsis and Iranis) and Bahá'í Faith in the world, 
        even though these religions initially grew in Persia. Throughout India's history, religion has been an important part of the country's culture. Religious diversity and religious tolerance are both established in the country by the law and custom; 
        the Constitution of India has declared the right to freedom of religion to be a fundamental right.

    <h2>Some prevailing religions in India are :</h2>
    <h3>Jainism</h3>
    <img src="images/religion/jain.jpg" alt="photo">
    <p>
        Jainism was established by a lineage of 24 enlightened beings culminating with Parsva (9th century BCE) and Mahavira (6th century BCE).
        The 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira, stressed five vows, including ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), asteya (non-stealing) and aparigraha (non-attachment). 
        Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars believe Parshva, accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the shramana movement.

    <h3>Buddhism</h3>
    <img src="images/religion/buddh.jpg" alt="photo">
    <p>
        Buddhism was historically founded by Siddhartha Gautama, a Kshatriya prince-turned-ascetic, and was spread beyond India through missionaries.
        It later experienced a decline in India, but survived in Nepal and Sri Lanka, and remains more widespread in Southeast and East Asia.
        Gautama Buddha, who was called an "awakened one" (Buddha), was born into the Shakya clan living at Kapilavastu and Lumbini in what is now southern Nepal. 
        The Buddha was born at Lumbini, as emperor Ashoka's Lumbini pillar records, just before the kingdom of Magadha (which traditionally is said to have lasted from c. 546–324 BCE) rose to power. 
        The Shakyas claimed Angirasa and Gautama Maharishi lineage, via descent from the royal lineage of Ayodhya.
        Buddhism emphasises enlightenment (nibbana, nirvana) and liberation from the rounds of rebirth.

    <h3>Hinduism</h3>

    <p>
        In the 19th century, under influence of the colonial forces, a synthetic vision of Hinduism was formulated by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi.
        These thinkers have tended to take an inclusive view of India's religious history, emphasising the similarities between the various Indian religions.
        <br>
        The modern era has given rise to dozens of Hindu saints with international influence.For example, Brahma Baba established the Brahma Kumaris, 
        one of the largest new Hindu religious movements which teaches the discipline of Raja Yoga to millions.
        Representing traditional Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Prabhupada founded the Hare Krishna movement, another organisation with a global reach. In late 18th-century India, Swaminarayan founded the Swaminarayan Sampraday. 
        Anandamurti, founder of the Ananda Marga, has also influenced many worldwide. Through the international influence of all of these new Hindu denominations,
        many Hindu practices such as yoga, meditation, mantra, divination, and vegetarianism have been adopted by new converts.
    </p>
    <h3>Sikhism</h3>

    <p>
        Sikhism originated in 15th-century Punjab, Delhi Sultanate (present-day India and Pakistan) with the teachings of Nanak and nine successive gurus. 
        The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in Vāhigurū— represented by the sacred symbol of ēk ōaṅkār [meaning one god].
        Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctly associated with the history, society and culture of the Punjab.
        Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs (students or disciples) and number over 27 million across the world.

    <h3>Christanity</h3>
    <img src="images/religion/christian.jpg" alt="photo">
    <p>
        Tradition says that Christianity was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and proselytized natives at large, 
        who are known as Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasrani) today. Although the exact origins of Christianity in India remain unclear, 
        there is a general scholarly consensus that Christianity was rooted in India by the 6th century AD, including some communities who used Syriac liturgically, and it is a possibility 
        that the religion's existence in India extends to as far back as the 1st century. Christianity in India has different denominations like Roman Catholicism, Protestantism,
        Oriental Orthodox etc.However, the story of St Thomas coming to India in 52 CE has been contradicted by a recorded history. There was a Thomas who came, but he was a Syrian merchant, Thomas of Cana, 
        and this happened around 500 or 600 CE. In-depth historical research on this topic can be found in the book by a Canadian author and a former Christian monk Ishwar Sharan and research conducted and published by Madras Courier.

    <h3>Islam</h3>

    <p>
        Islam is the second largest religion in India, with 14.2% of the country's population or roughly 172 million people identifying as adherents of Islam (2011 census).
        It makes India the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries.
        Though Islam came to India in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders in Malabar coast, Kerala, 
        it started to become a major religion during the Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent. Islam's spread in India mostly took place under the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and the Mughal Empire (1526–1858), greatly aided by the mystic Sufi tradition.
